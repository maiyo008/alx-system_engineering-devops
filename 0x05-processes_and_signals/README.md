##Tasks
---
### Task 0
* Write a Bash script that displays its own PID.

### Task 1
* Write a Bash script that displays a list of currently running processes.
* Requirements:
	* Must show all processes, for all users, including those which might not have a TTY
	* Display in a user-oriented format
	* Show process hierarchy

### Task 2
* Using your previous exercise command, write a Bash script that displays lines containing the bash word, thus allowing you to easily get the PID of your Bash process.
* Requirements:
	* You cannot use `pgrep`
	* The third line of your script must be # shellcheck disable=SC2009 (for more info about ignoring shellcheck error [here](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/Ignore))

### Task 3
* Write a Bash script that displays the PID, along with the process name, of processes whose name contain the word `bash.`
* Requirement:
	* You cannot use `ps`
